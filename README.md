# A Terrible Chess Engine

Some chess engine made by people who don't know what they're doing.

The idea is that you'll never lose (even if you try).

This project was inspired by "one of those" 2AM ideas and since I don't really know any other language (besides Python) I decided to go with it anyway.
The whole thing is written in python and it runs on the browser thanks to a wonderfull thing called [Brython](https://brython.info/).

Unfortunately, for speed reasons, the AI only looks "one move ahead" and, as a result, plays like a toddler that only knows one opening.

I might redo this in the future, but for now I'm happy with it working. This was made mostly for learning purposes and should not be used as a basis for... really anything.
